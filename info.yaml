  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Valid values for analog projects: 1x2, 2x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 5        # Valid values: 0 to 6

    - "project.v"

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
pinout:
  # Inputs
